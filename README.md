## Strategy
Grandma Maebelle has been baking pies for county fairs, bake sales, and school fundraisers for years. Everyone's always said she could make real money selling her famous pies, and she's finally decided to go into business. She's setting up a small website to advertise to a broader, hipper, web-savvy audienceâ€”the kind of people who spend more time on Facebook than at the fair. The site will share Maebelle's pie menu, emphasize her 100% handmade approach to pie baking, and allow customers to place online orders using a form. The site's primary users are people who want a quick, easy way to order a delicious pie.

## Scope
- Describe the history of Grandma's Pie Shop: who is Maebelle? Why does she like to bake? What's her approach to pie baking (100% handmade, organic/local ingredients where possible)?
- Provide a menu: photos and descriptions of pies, including specials.
- Order form: initially, customers will pay for the pies when they pick them up; the site may eventually incorporate an online payment system.
- Press & customer reviews: provide excerpts of what satisfied customers have had to say about Maebelle's pies; link to news & magazine articles about the business.
- A contact page (contact form that generates an email, phone number)
