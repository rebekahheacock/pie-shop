## TODO

- validation
- final report
	- 5 min screencast OR 2 page report
	- Who is the primary audience for the site? Are there secondary audiences?
	- Provide links to pages of your site. Clearly indicate the home page and also the "function" component.
	- Discuss the implementation of the site (including content, design, and technology).
	- Since this is only the beginning of the site, briefly mention ideas you have for future work and/or expansion
	- What worked well? What parts of the project are you particularly pleased with, and why? What parts of the project need additional work? If you were to approach this project again, what you do the same? What would you do differently?
