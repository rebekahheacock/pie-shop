			<p>Grandma Maebelle's pies are 100% handmade, from the butter churned by Maebelle's daughter Clara on the family farm to the apples picked just down the road to the lattice crust woven by Maebelle's son Bertold. Every pie we sell is hand formed and baked fresh that day. Come by, and you may just get to taste a slice right out of the oven.</p> 

			<p>We place an emphasis on organic and local ingredients where possible. We rely on our family's 115-year-old dairy farm for fresh cream and butter, and we can tell you which of our chickens laid the eggs for your coconut cream pie. We buy apples, peaches, and berries from our neighbors, and our flour is milled locally.</p>

			<p>Maebelle has been baking pies for county fairs, bake sales, and school fundraisers for as long as people 'round these parts can remember. Our pies—warm cinnamon-spiced apple, tangy lemon piled high with clouds of meringue, dreamy coconut cream, and more–have been featured in <em>The Ambrose Gazette</em>, <em>The Danville Chronicle</em>, <em>The Hillborough Daily</em>, <em>Food & Wine Magazine</em>, and <em>Bon Appétit</em>.</p>
