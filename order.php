			<p>Grandma Maebelle's pies are 100% handmade, from the butter churned by Maebelle's daughter Clara on the family farm to the apples picked just down the road to the lattice crust woven by Maebelle's son Bertold. Every pie we sell is hand formed and baked fresh that day. Come by, and you may just get to taste a slice right out of the oven.</p> 

			<p>Maebelle has been baking pies for county fairs, bake sales, and school fundraisers for as long as people 'round these parts can remember. Our pies—warm cinnamon-spiced apply, tangy lemon piled high with clouds of meringue, dreamy coconut cream, and more–have been featured in <em>The Ambrose Gazette</em>, <em>The Danville Chronicle</em>, <em>The Hillborough Daily</em>, <em>Food & Wine Magazine</em>, and <em>Bon Appétit</em>.</p>
